      <li>Amit took a personal loan of INR 50,000 on a 12-month EMI from DMI. </li>
      <li>Amitâ€™s EMI is INR 4,631 per month and the original total interest to be paid by him is INR 6,736. </li>
      <li>If Amit decides to opt-in for 3-months moratorium, he will end up paying an <b>additional interest of INR
          3,473 which is 51% of the original interest.</b></li>

    <p>For every EMI you pay on time and as per schedule, you will be supporting us to contribute towards feeding the
      hungry.</p>
